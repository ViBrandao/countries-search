## ðŸ”–&nbsp; About

The **Search Countries** project was made to improve my skills in Next.js.

Basically you can search for countries by name, click on them to find out more information, mark them, and this way access your custom countries page.

To mark your countries and access your custom page, you need to login with GitHub.

The countries information is taken from the [Rest Countries Api](https://restcountries.eu/).

To register the marked countries, the serverless database [FaunaDB](https://fauna.com/) is used.
